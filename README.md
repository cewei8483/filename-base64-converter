# filename-base64-converter
A base64 filename encoder/decoder in a designated folder. Written in Python 3.8.5.

Encoding and decoding are both url-safe. (urlsafe_b64encode/urlsafe_b64decode)

***Note that the converter deals specially with .rar files.*** Change the string-matching part if you want to use it on other extensions.
